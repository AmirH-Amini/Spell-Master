# Spell Master: Master the English Spelling

Improve your English spelling skills and monitor your progress with this app.

## Overview

SpellMaster is a Python application that helps users enhance their English spelling abilities. The app randomly selects a word from a wordlist, uses a Text-to-Speech (TTS) service to pronounce it, and then prompts the user to enter the correct spelling.

## Features

Inspired by the popular flashcards app Anki, SpellMaster offers a similar learning experience, focusing on English spelling practice. Key features include:

- Difficulty Levels: easy, tricky, hard
- Notes: Users can add notes to each word
- Wordlist: Use your own words or choose from a pre-defined list provided by the app
- Practice Different Categories: such as science, sports, entertainment, and business
- Track Your Progress: Monitor correct and incorrect spellings over time
- Customizable Practice Session: Users can select the difficulty level, word list, and categories

## Motivation

I developed this app during my IELTS preparation to improve my spelling skills and I hope it will be beneficial for others as well.
